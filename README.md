Training FMNIST and MNIST dataset on Feed Forward Neural Network
## MNIST and FMNIST Dataset
### MNIST Dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

### FMNIST Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is an alternative to the standard MNIST dataset. Instead of handwritten digits, it contains 70000 28x28 grayscale images of ten types of fashion items.
